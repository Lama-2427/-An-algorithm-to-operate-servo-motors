The key aspects of the algorithm are:

Initialization:
Initialize the servo motors and determine the initial joint positions.
This may involve calibrating the servos, setting up the servo controller, and reading the current joint angles.
Defining the Walking Sequence:
Determine the desired walking motion, including the sequence of leg movements and weight shifting.
This may involve defining a set of joint angle targets for each phase of the walking cycle.
Joint Angle Calculation:
For each step in the walking sequence, calculate the new joint angles required to achieve the desired foot placement and body position.
This may involve inverse kinematics calculations to determine the servo angles needed to position the feet and maintain balance.
Smooth Servo Transitions:
Smoothly transition the servo motors to the new joint angles over a set time period.
This helps to ensure smooth, continuous movement and avoid abrupt changes that could destabilize the robot.
Techniques like interpolation or spline-based trajectories can be used to generate smooth servo control signals.
Timing and Stabilization:
Pause briefly after each step to allow the robot to stabilize and maintain balance.
The duration of the pause may depend on factors like the robot's mass, the walking speed, and the sensor feedback.
Sensor Feedback and Adjustments:
Monitor sensor data (e.g., IMU, contact sensors) to detect any balance or stability issues.
Adjust the walking sequence or joint angle targets in real-time to maintain balance and stability.
This may involve using control algorithms like PID controllers or more advanced techniques like model predictive control.
